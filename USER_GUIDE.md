During the Scan the button will change to Stop Scan, which you can click to cancel the scan at any time.  
A status message will show "Scanning...".  
The scan is limited to: A maximum of 5 directory levels deep and a maximum of 10,000 files and directories.  
Once the scan is complete, you'll see a status message (e.g., "Scan complete! Found 150 files and 15 directories. Total size: 450.20 MB").  
Below this, a scrollable list will show the first 100 items found. Directories are listed by path, and files are listed with their path and size in your chosen unit.

You will see two options:  
Scan Filter: This controls what files the scanner looks for.
* or *.*: Finds all files.  
*.txt: Finds only files ending in .txt.  
*.jpg: Finds only files ending in .jpg.  
Display Unit: This changes the unit display file sizes (KB, MB, or GB). This affects both the file list and the total size summary.  
After making your changes, click Save Settings. Your preferences will be saved and automatically loaded the next time you open Disk Maid.
